# ChessBoard

Chess board applicaton to satisfy criteria as mentioned below:
CHESS
You are required to create a program, which simulates a chessboard and the
movements of various types of pieces on the chessboard.
Chessboard:
The chessboard is an 8 x 8 grid with 64 cells in it.
With 8 rows (A, B, C…. H) and 8 columns (1, 2, 3…. 8), each cell can be uniquely
identified with its cell number. This can be seen illustrated below.
A8 B8 C8 D8 E8 F8 G8 H8
A7 B7 C7 D7 E7 F7 G7 H7
A6 B6 C6 D6 E6 F6 G6 H6
A5 B5 C5 D5 E5 F5 G5 H5
A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 F4 G4 H4
A3 B3 C3 D3 E3 F3 G3 H3
A2 B2 C2 D2 E2 F2 G2 H2
A1 B1 C1 D1 E1 F1 G1 H1
Chess pieces and their movements:
The game of chess has 6 unique types of pieces, with their own unique types
of movements. These are:
1.) King – Can move only 1 step at a time in all 8 directions (horizontal, vertical
and diagonal)
2.) Queen – Can move across the board in all 8 directions
3.) Bishop – Can move across the board only diagonally
4.) Horse – Can move across the board only in 2.5 steps (2 vertical steps and 1
horizontal step)
5.) Rook – Can move across the board only vertically and horizontally
6.) Pawn – Can move only 1 step at a time, in the forward direction, vertically.
Can also move 1 step forward diagonally, in order to eliminate an opposing
piece.
Objective of your program:
Your program should simulate the movement of each unique chess piece on an
empty chessboard.
• Input – The input string to your program will be the Type of chess piece and
its Position (cell number) on the chessboard. E.g. “King D5”
• Output – Once you execute the program, the output will be a string of all
possible cells in which the chess piece can move.
Sample inputs and outputs:
Input – “King D5”
Output – “D6, E6, E5, E4, D4, C4, C5, C6”
A8 B8 C8 D8 E8 F8 G8 H8
A7 B7 C7 D7 E7 F7 G7 H7
A6 B6 C6 D6 E6 F6 G6 H6
A5 B5 C5 D5 E5 F5 G5 H5
A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 F4 G4 H4
A3 B3 C3 D3 E3 F3 G3 H3
A2 B2 C2 D2 E2 F2 G2 H2
A1 B1 C1 D1 E1 F1 G1 H1
Input – “Horse E3”
Output – “F5, G4, G2, F1, D1, C2, C4, D5”
A8 B8 C8 D8 E8 F8 G8 H8
A7 B7 C7 D7 E7 F7 G7 H7
A6 B6 C6 D6 E6 F6 G6 H6
A5 B5 C5 D5 E5 F5 G5 H5
A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 F4 G4 H4
A3 B3 C3 D3 E3 F3 G3 H3
A2 B2 C2 D2 E2 F2 G2 H2
A1 B1 C1 D1 E1 F1 G1 H1
Assumption:
Assume that the board is empty. This means that the pawn cannot move
diagonally.
